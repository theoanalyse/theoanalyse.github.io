\section{From Operator Semigroups to Spectral Theory}
\label{app:SpecTheo}

(\com{Maybe put this section in Appendix})
In this section, we introduce classical results from semigroup and spectral theory to prove that the RD system has solutions under relatively weak assumptions.


The system can be rewritten more generally under the form

$$\left\{\begin{aligned}
& \del_t \xi = L \xi + N(\xi)  \quad &\xi = (\bm u, \bm v) - (\bar{\bm u}, \bar{\bm v})  \\[1em]
& \xi(0, x) \in L^\infty(\Omega)^m \times L ^{\infty}(\Omega)^k    
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$

With the linear operator part of the system

$$L \xi = \bpm \bm{0} & \bm{0} \\ \bm{0}& D\epm \lap \xi + \bpm j_{11} & j_{12} \\ j_{21} & j_{22} \epm \xi $$
and the non-linear part being the terms of order $\ge2$ in the expansion of $\xi$



\section{Conditions Required for Diffusion Driven Instabilities (DDI)}
\label{app:Turing}

We provide a set of conditions for one to obtain DDI for a $n$-dimensional reaction diffusion  (RD). Such systems are often represented under the form
$$\del_t u - D \lap u = F(U)$$
with $u \in \R^n$, $D \in \euM_n(\R)$ and $F \in \mathcal C^1(\R^n, \R^n)$. Let $\bar u$ be a constant equilibrium of the system and introduce $B := \mathcal J_F(\bar u)$ the Jacobian matrix of $F$ computed at the steady-state $\bar u$. Consider a small perturbation $\xi := u - \bar u \in \R^n$ around the steady state and linearize the system around $\bar u$.
$$\del_t \xi - D \lap \xi = B \xi $$
Now look for solutions of the form $\xi(x, t) = e^{\lambda t} \Phi(x)$ yields $D\lap \Phi + (B - \lambda) \Phi = 0$. We then decompose $\Phi = \sum_{m \ge 0} y_m \varphi_m(x)$ in the basis composed of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian with Neumann boundary conditions.
