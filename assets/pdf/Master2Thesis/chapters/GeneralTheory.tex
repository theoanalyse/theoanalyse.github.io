\section{General Theory}

This chapter is dedicated to the analytical study of general forms of RD-ODE systems. For that, we start by introducing the two definitions

\begin{definition}[Sobolev spaces]
	Let $\Omega \subset \R^d$ be a bounded domain with $\del \Omega \in \mathcal C^1$. We denote by $W^{k, p}(\Omega)$ the Sobolev space defined by
	$$W^{k, p}(\Omega) := \lc u \in L^p(\Omega) : \forall \alpha \in \N^d, \varphi \in \mathcal C^\infty(\Omega), \exists v \in L^p(\Omega) : \int_\Omega v \varphi = (-1)^{|\alpha|} \int_\Omega u \del^\alpha \varphi \rc$$   
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Laplace operator on a bounded domain]
	
	We define the \textbf{Laplace operator}  $\Delta$ on a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \R^d$ endowed with Neumann boundary conditions ($\del_{\nu} = 0$ on $\del\Omega$) through the relation
	$$\Delta_\nu = \sum_{i=1}^d \frac{\del^2}{\del x_i^2}.$$
	Furthermore, $-\Delta_\nu$ has a discrete spectrum consisting of a sequence of non-decreasing, non-negative eigenvalues 
	$\{\mu_j\}_{j\ge 0}$ with $\mu_0 = 0$, $\mu_n \xrightarrow{n \to \infty} \infty$ and has domain $\mathrm{Dom}(-\Delta_\nu) = W_\nu^{2,p}(\Omega)$ (the space of functions $u\in W^{2,p}(\Omega)$ such that $\del_\nu u_{\vert \del\Omega} = 0$).
\end{definition}

For the sake of notation, we also  drop the $\nu$ symbol in the Laplace operator. i.e., we will write $\Delta_\nu = \Delta$. 

\subsection{Derivation of reaction-diffusion equations}


In this section we seek to derive reaction-diffusion equations from scratch based on famous physical principles. The derivation is performed under strong regularity assumptions and has for purpose to give the reader a physical intuition behind RD equations. To this end, introduce the divergence theorem which is required for the following computations  

\begin{theorem}[Divergence theorem]
	Consider a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \R^d$, enclosed by the surface $\Gamma := \del \Omega \subset \R^{d-1}$. Let $\bm F$ be an arbitrary smooth vector field and the application $\nu$ such that for all $\xi \in S$, $\nu(\xi)$ is the outward-pointing unit vector of $S$ at $\xi$. Finally, if $dA$ denotes the measure $d x_1 ... d x_d$ and $ds$ is the surface measure, then the following equality holds
	
	$$\oint_\Gamma \lp \bm F \cdot \nu \rp ds = \int_\Omega \grad \cdot \lp \bm F\rp d A$$
\end{theorem}

General laws of conservation tell us that if $u$ denotes a physical concentration (heat, cells, gene expression, receptors, ...), then

$$\underbrace{\frac{\del}{\del t} \int_{\Omega} u d\Omega}_{\text{amount of material in } \Omega} =  \underbrace{D \oint_\Gamma \lp \grad u \cdot \nu \rp d\Gamma}_{\text{flux of material crossing } \Gamma} + \underbrace{\int_\Omega f(u) d\Omega}_{\text{material created inside} \Omega}.$$

Where we obtained the diffusive flux of material crossing $\Gamma$ using Fick's law. Now using the divergence theorem on the second integral yields

$$\int_{\Omega} \frac{\del u}{\del t} d\Omega =  \int_\Omega D \grad \cdot \lp \grad u \rp d\Omega + \int_\Omega f(u) d\Omega.$$

Which after reordering the terms and putting everyone under the same integral is equivalent to

$$\int_\Omega \lp \frac{\del u}{\del t}(x, t) - D \Delta u (x, t) - f(u(x, t)) \rp d\Omega = 0$$

Under smoothness assumptions on each term being integrated and a choice of $\Omega$ satisfying $\mu(\Omega) > 0$ ($\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure), we deduce that what is under the integral must vanish. i.e., 

\begin{equation}\label{rdeq} \frac{\del u }{\del t}(x, t) = D \Delta u(x, t) + f(x, t)\end{equation}

Which, once embedded with boundary and initial conditions, is the form under which most classical reaction-diffusion systems are presented in the literature.

\subsection{Reaction-Diffusion-ODE problems}

Until recently, the matrix $D$ in (\ref{rdeq}) was mainly chosen as a diagonal matrix $D = diag(d_1, ..., d_d)$, with $d_i > 0$, $i = 1, ..., d$. Taking a coefficient $d_i = 0$ results in canceling the effect of the Laplace operator, thus transforming equation $i$ into a classical ODE coupled to the PDE system. In this paragraph, we inspect the properties of such systems coupling $k >0$ ODE to $m > 0$ reaction-diffusion equations. For that, let $n \in \N$ such that $m+k = n$ and a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \R^{n}$. Let us consider the $\mathcal-C^2$ nonlinearities $\bm f : \R^k \times \R^m \longrightarrow \R^{m+k}$ describing the reaction kinetics between each components of the system. We aim to investigate properties of
 
\begin{align}
	& \del_t\uu  = \bm{\mathrm D} \Delta \uu + \bm{f}(\uu) \quad\quad \text{on } \Omega \times \mathbb R^{+} \notag \\  &\del_\nu u_i = 0 \qquad\qquad\qquad\! \text{on } \del\Omega \times \mathbb R^{+}, \text{ for } i \in [\![ m+1, k ]\!]\\
	&\bm{u}(\cdot, 0) = \bm{u}_0(\cdot) \qquad\qquad\; \text{on } \Omega, \notag
\end{align}


\subsubsection{Existence of solutions}

The goal of this section is to show that for an autonomous abstract Cauchy problem, if the operator $A$ is the infinitesimal generator of an analytic $C_0$-semigroup of operators, then the problem admits a unique solution whose regularity depends on the regularity of the initial condition.

\begin{definition}[Abstract Cauchy problem] La définition du problème de Cauchy abstrait nous vient de E. Hille 
	\begin{align}
		\del_t u = Au + f(u) \notag \\
		u(0) = u_0 \notag
	\end{align}
\end{definition}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Abstract Cauchy Problem
	\item 
\end{itemize}


\begin{theorem}[Spectral Mapping Theorem] 
	Consider a locally compact space $X$. Let $A$ be the generator of a positive, bounded, compact, strongly continuous group on $\mathcal C_0(X)$, denoted by $(L(t))_{t\in\R}.$ Then
	$$\sigma(L(t)) = \overline{\exp(t \sigma(A))}$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	see Theorem 1.1. from \cite{Arendt1984}
\end{proof}


%
%\begin{proposition}[Generated Semigroups]
%	The operator $L$ generates an analytic $\mathcal C^0$-semigroup $(T(t))_{t\ge 0}$ through the map $t \longmapsto \exp(tL)$. The system $\del_t \xi = L\xi$ is therefore linearly stable if the growth exponent $w < 0$. It is linearly unstable otherwise.
%\end{proposition}
%
%\begin{definition}[Mild solutions]
%	Let $X$ be a Banach space and take $L$, the infinitesimal generator of a $\mathcal C^0$-semigroup $(T(t))_{t\ge 0}$. Let $\xi : I \times \Omega \longrightarrow \R^{m+k}$ such that $\xi(t, \cdot) \in X$. The function $\xi$ is said to be a mild solution of the system if it obeys
%	$$\xi(t, \cdot) = T(t)\xi(0, \cdot) + \int_{0}^{t} T(t- \tau) \xi(\tau, \cdot) d\tau$$
%\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Submatrices defined by a pair of indices]
	Consider a matrix $A \in \euM_n(\R)$, for any couple of distinct indices $(i, j)$ with $1 \le i, j \le n$, we introduce the notation $A_{ij}$ to be the $2 \! \times \! 2$-matrix whose entries are formed by the entries of $A$ on line and column $i, j$.
\end{definition}


\begin{proposition}[Characteristic polynomial of a $3\times3$ matrix] Consider a matrix $A \in \euM_3(\R)$ whose entries are the $a_{ij}$ for $1 \le i, j \le 3$. Then 
	$$\chi_A(\lambda) = -\lambda^3 + \tr(A) \lambda^2 - \lp \sum_{i < j} \det(A_{ij})\rp \lambda + \det(A)$$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	It is a straightforward computation. The result is obtained by expanding and refactoring the expression $\det(A - \lambda)$
\end{proof}
