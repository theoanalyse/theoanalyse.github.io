\section{General Theory}

This chapter is dedicated to the analytical study of general forms of RD-ODE systems. For that, we start by introducing the two definitions

\begin{definition}[Sobolev spaces]
	Let $\Omega \subset \R^d$ be a bounded domain with $\del \Omega \in \mathcal C^1$. We denote by $W^{k, p}(\Omega)$ the Sobolev space defined by
	$$W^{k, p}(\Omega) := \lc u \in L^p(\Omega) : \forall \alpha \in \N^d, \varphi \in \mathcal C^\infty(\Omega), \exists v \in L^p(\Omega) : \int_\Omega v \varphi = (-1)^{|\alpha|} \int_\Omega u \del^\alpha \varphi \rc$$   
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Laplace operator]
	
	We define the \textbf{Laplace operator}  $\Delta$ on a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \R^d$ endowed with Neumann boundary conditions ($\del_{\nu} = 0$ on $\del\Omega$) through the relation
	$$\Delta_\nu = \sum_{i=1}^d \frac{\del^2}{\del x_i^2}.$$
	Furthermore, $-\Delta_\nu$ has a discrete spectrum consisting of a sequence of non-decreasing, non-negative eigenvalues 
	$\{\mu_j\}_{j\ge 0}$ with $\mu_0 = 0$, $\mu_n \xrightarrow{n \to \infty} \infty$ and has domain $\mathrm{Dom}(-\Delta_\nu) = W_\nu^{2,p}(\Omega)$ (the space of functions $u\in W^{2,p}(\Omega)$ such that $\del_\nu u_{\vert \del\Omega} = 0$).
\end{definition}

For the sake of notation, we also  drop the $\nu$ symbol in the Laplace operator. i.e., we will write $\Delta_\nu = \Delta$. 


\subsection{Reaction-Diffusion-ODE problems}

Reaction-diffusion-ODE systems are what one obtains when writing evolution equations for coupled diffusive and non-diffusive quantities. Mathematically, this rewrites under the formed of Until recently, the matrix $D$ in (\ref{eq:rdeq}) was mainly chosen as a diagonal matrix $D = diag(d_1, ..., d_d)$, with $d_i > 0$, $i = 1, ..., d$. Taking a coefficient $d_i = 0$ results in canceling the effect of the Laplace operator, thus transforming equation $i$ into a classical ODE coupled to the PDE system. In this paragraph, we inspect the properties of such systems coupling $k >0$ ODE to $m > 0$ reaction-diffusion equations. For that, let $n \in \N$ such that $m+k = n$ and a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \R^{n}$. Let us consider the $\mathcal{C}^2$-nonlinearities $\bm f : \R^k \times \R^m \longrightarrow \R^{m+k}$ describing the reaction kinetics between each components of the system. We aim to investigate properties of

\subsubsection{Existence of solutions}

The goal of this section is to show that for an autonomous abstract Cauchy problem, if the operator $A$ is the infinitesimal generator of an analytic $C_0$-semigroup of operators, then the problem admits a unique solution whose regularity depends on the regularity of the initial condition.

\begin{definition}[Abstract Cauchy problem] La définition du problème de Cauchy abstrait nous vient de E. Hille 
	\begin{align}
		\del_t u = Au + f(u) \notag \\
		u(0) = u_0 \notag
	\end{align}
\end{definition}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Abstract Cauchy Problem
	\item \texttt{}
\end{itemize}


\begin{theorem}[Spectral Mapping Theorem] 
	Consider a locally compact space $X$. Let $A$ be the generator of a positive, bounded, compact, strongly continuous group on $\mathcal C_0(X)$, denoted by $(L(t))_{t\in\R}.$ Then
	$$\sigma(L(t)) = \overline{\exp(t \sigma(A))}$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	see Theorem 1.1. from \cite{Arendt1984}
\end{proof}


%
%\begin{proposition}[Generated Semigroups]
%	The operator $L$ generates an analytic $\mathcal C^0$-semigroup $(T(t))_{t\ge 0}$ through the map $t \longmapsto \exp(tL)$. The system $\del_t \xi = L\xi$ is therefore linearly stable if the growth exponent $w < 0$. It is linearly unstable otherwise.
%\end{proposition}
%
%\begin{definition}[Mild solutions]
%	Let $X$ be a Banach space and take $L$, the infinitesimal generator of a $\mathcal C^0$-semigroup $(T(t))_{t\ge 0}$. Let $\xi : I \times \Omega \longrightarrow \R^{m+k}$ such that $\xi(t, \cdot) \in X$. The function $\xi$ is said to be a mild solution of the system if it obeys
%	$$\xi(t, \cdot) = T(t)\xi(0, \cdot) + \int_{0}^{t} T(t- \tau) \xi(\tau, \cdot) d\tau$$
%\end{definition}


\begin{proof}
	It is a straightforward computation. The result is obtained by expanding and refactoring the expression $\det(A - \lambda)$
\end{proof}

    \item Linear / NonLinear decomposition
    \item Bound on the Nonlinear part $\mathcal N$
    
    \item Why is the spectrum so important here
    \item Define DDI
    \item Maybe include Finn's result on the $d_1$ $d_2$ ? (and add full acknowledgement to his work)
    \item linearization of a PDE system
    \item Solving for the eigenvalue problem
