%ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
This thesis builds upon previous work pioneered by Anna Marciniak-Czochra \cite{AnnaThesis}, in using coupled reaction-diffusion equations to ODE to model receptor dynamics in Hydra, a freshwater polyp known for its regenerative abilities. Previous studies have shown that such models can successfully capture the emergence of spatial patterns of gene expression during regeneration, and have identified key signaling molecules such as Wnt, $\beta$-catenin and Notch as playing a critical role in this process. In this work, we come back to the model presented in \cite{AnnaThesis} that integrates a  reaction-diffusion-ODE system (1 ODE + 2 PDE) and see how far we can go in reducing the amount of parameters and investigating the phenomenon of pattern formation after reduction.

\subsection{Deriving reaction-diffusion equations}

In this section we seek to derive reaction-diffusion equations from scratch based on famous physical principles. We assume to have enough regularity for each quantity in order to carry out the computations. This derivation has for purpose to give the reader a physical intuition behind such equations. To this end, we first introduce the following divergence theorem

\begin{theorem}[Gauss-Green theorem]
	Consider a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \R^d$, enclosed by the surface $\Gamma := \del \Omega \subset \R^{d-1}$. Let $\bm F$ be an arbitrary smooth vector field and an application $\nu$ such that for all $\xi \in S$, $\nu(\xi)$ is the outward-pointing unit vector of $S$ at $\xi$. Finally, if $dA$ denotes the measure $d x_1 ... d x_d$ and $ds$ is the surface measure on $\Gamma$, then the following equality holds
	
	$$\int_\Gamma \lp \bm F \cdot \nu \rp ds = \int_\Omega \grad \cdot \lp \bm F\rp d A.$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Various well-known proofs exist in the literature (see \cite{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.0807.0088} for the original derivation by G. Green)
\end{proof}

We are all set, let us proceed. General laws of conservation tell us that if $u$ denotes a physical quantity (heat, amount of cells, gene expression, ...), then

$$\underbrace{\frac{\del}{\del t} \int_{\Omega} u d\Omega}_{\text{amount of material in } \Omega} =  \underbrace{D \int_\Gamma \lp \grad u \cdot \nu \rp d\Gamma}_{\text{flux of material crossing } \Gamma} + \underbrace{\int_\Omega f(u) d\Omega}_{\text{material created inside} \Omega}.$$

Where we obtained the diffusive flux of material crossing $\Gamma$ using Fick's law. Now using the divergence theorem on the second integral yields

$$\int_{\Omega} \frac{\del u}{\del t} d\Omega =  \int_\Omega D \grad \cdot \lp \grad u \rp d\Omega + \int_\Omega f(u) d\Omega.$$

After reordering the terms, we put everyone under the same integral and find

$$\int_\Omega \lp \frac{\del u}{\del t}(x, t) - D \Delta u (x, t) - f(u(x, t)) \rp d\Omega = 0.$$

Each term being integrated on an arbitrary $\Omega$ with size $\mu(\Omega) > 0$, we deduce that what is under the integral must vanish. i.e., 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:rdeq} \frac{\del u }{\del t}(x, t) = D \Delta u(x, t) + f(x, t)\end{equation}

Appropriate boundary conditions are to be chosen accordingly to the nature of the studied problem. As far as we are concerned, homogeneous Neumann (or \textit{zero-flux}) boundary conditions will be considered


%\subsection{Theory of Turing instability}
%\label{appendix:LinStab}
%
%Consider a given smooth vector field $\bm{f} = (f^1, ..., f^n)$ on $\R^n$ admitting an equilibrium point $\bar{\bm x}$. We introduce the following system of PDE
%
%\begin{align}
%	\del_t \bm{u} - \DD \Delta \bm{u} = \bm f(\uu) &\qquad \text{ on } \Omega \times (0, T), \label{eq:APDE}\\ 
%	\del_\nu \cdot \uu = 0 &\qquad \text{ on } \del\Omega \times (0, T), \\
%	\uu(\bm x, 0) = \uu_0(\bm x) &\qquad \text{ on } \Omega,
%\end{align}
%as well as the corresponding (associated) system of ODE
%
%\begin{align}
%	\dot{\vv} = \bm f(\vv) &\qquad \text{ on } (0, T),
%\end{align}
%
%where $\Omega \subset \R^n$ is open, bounded and $(0, T), T>0$ is a finite time interval. The matrix $\DD = \mathrm{diag}(d_1, ..., d_n)$ with $d_i \ge 0$ is the matrix whose entries are the diffusion coefficients in front of the Laplace operator. Additionally, we let $\uu = (u^1, ..., u^n)$ and $\vv = (v^1, ..., v^n)$ denote unknown functions.
%\medskip
%
%For a sufficiently small $\eps > 0$, take a small perturbation $\bm \xi \in L^p(B(\bar{\bm x}, \varepsilon))$ and define $\bm V = \bar{\bm x} + \bm \xi$. The linearization of ODE system around $\bar{\bm x}$ is the linear equation
%
%\begin{align}
%	\label{eq:ALinearized}
%	\dot{\bm V}  &= \bm J \bm V,
%\end{align}
%
%where $\bm J = \jac_{\bm f}(\bar{\bm x})$. The theory of linear ODE guarantees that solutions of (\ref{eq:ALinearized}) are asymptotically stable whenever the eigenvalues of $\bm J$ have negative real part \textit{i.e.,} $\RE(\lambda) < 0$ for each $\lambda \in \sigma(\bm J)$. Similarly, by linearity of Laplace operator, we obtain the linearized system around $\bar{\bm x}$
%
%\begin{align}
%	\label{eq:ALinearized2}
%	\del_t \bm U - \DD \Delta \bm U &= \bm J \bm U,
%\end{align}
%
%with, $\bm U = \bar{\bm x} + \bm \eta$, the perturbed steady state and $\bm \eta \in L^p \bigl(B(\bar{\bm x}, \eps) \bigr)$ another sufficiently small perturbation. A separation of variable combined with knowledge on the spectral decomposition of the Laplace operator yields the existence of an exponentially decreasing in time representation for $\bm U$ in the $L^2$ orthonormal basis given by eigenfunctions, $\left\{\bm \phi_j(x) \right\}_{j=1}^\infty \subset L^2(\Omega)$. For $j = 1, ...$, each $\bm \phi_j$ satisfies the relation $-\Delta \bm \phi_j = \lambda_j \bm \phi_j$, inviting us to conveniently write the convergent series
%
%$$\bm U(\bm x , t) = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} e^{\mu t} \bm y_j \bm \phi (\bm x), \quad\quad \bm y_j \text{ constant vector}.$$
%
%Substituting $\bm U$ back in (\ref{eq:ALinearized2}) leads to finding all $\bm U$ such that $(\bm J - \lambda_j \DD - \mu I_n)\bm U = 0$. Non-trivial solutions exist if, and only if, the dispersion relation
%
%$$\det (\bm J - \lambda_j \DD - \mu I_n) = 0,$$
%
%is satisfied. Notice that, in our case, $\mu = \mu(\lambda_j)$ depends on $\lambda_j$ and obeys some algebraic relation describing the growth rate of our solutions. Upon closer look, solving the dispertion relation is nothing but equivalent to finding the roots $(\mu^1, ..., \mu^n)$ of the characteristic polynomial $\chi_{\bm J_j}$ of
%$$\bm J_j := \bm J - \lambda_j \DD \quad\quad (j=1, ... \quad ).$$
%
%This means that the asymptotic stability of the linearized PDE system around $\bar{\bm x}$ is characterized by $\sigma(\bm J_j)$, the spectrum of $J_j$ through
%
%$$\text{System is asymptotically, linearly stable} \qquad\iff \qquad \bm{\mathrm{Re}}(\mu) < 0, \quad (j=1, ..., \quad \mu \in \sigma(\bm J_j) \ ).$$ 
%\medskip
%
%Therefore the stability of the linearized PDE is dependent on the choice of diffusion matrix $\DD$. This is precisely the idea behind Turing's instability principle: The Laplace operator is well-known for its nice smoothing properties. However, under "good" conditions, it is possible that adding diffusion will perturbate an, \textit{a priori}, asymptotically stable steady-state of the linearized associated ODE system. This phenomenon is called {\textbf{Turing instability}}.
%When Turing instability occurs, we say that \textbf{the steady state} $\bar{\bm x}$ \textbf{exhibits diffusion-driven instability (DDI for short)} and from there, several scenarios are possible. We emphasize the fact that Turing instability is a local property that has repercussions at a larger scale. 
%\medskip
%
%\begin{remark}[Extending linear results to the nonlinear dynamic]
%	It can be shown ([Finn, Chris, AMC]) that, for RD-ODE systems, whenever the spectral bound $$s(\bm J_j) := \sup_{\mu \in \sigma(\bm J_j)} \RE(\mu )$$ of $\bm J_j$ is negative, the growth exponent is negative as well. Techniques provided by the theory of analytic semigroups are used to prove that asymptotic stability of the linearized system of PDE implies the asymptotic stability of the nonlinear system too.
%\end{remark}
%\medskip
%
%\begin{remark}[Turing Patterns]
%	Finding steady-states of RD-ODE systems can be hard, if not impossible. Apart from constant ones (if even), steady-states of such PDE are described by a system of $k$ elliptic PDE. In fact, whenever $k > 1$, this task becomes to difficult and therefore a new approach is required. A common technique that we use in this manuscript is to look for constant steady-states $\bar{\bm x}$ of the system and then choose $\DD$ carefully so that DDI occurs around $\bar{\bm x}$ (if possible). 
%	Next, numerically solve the full system with initial condition $\bm u_0$ close to $\bar{\bm x}$. For $T > 0$ large enough, we fetch the numerical solution and check if it is continuous (should be for $T < \infty$) and if it also solves the system. If so,  the obtained function is a continuous, stable, spatially-heterogeneous, steady-steady state of (\ref{eq:APDE}), i.e., a \textbf{Turing Pattern}.
%\end{remark}
