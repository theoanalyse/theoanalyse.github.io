% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
    This thesis builds upon previous work pioneered by Anna Marciniak-Czochra in using coupled reaction-diffusion equations to ODE to model pattern formation in Hydra, a freshwater polyp known for its regenerative abilities. Previous studies have shown that such models can successfully capture the emergence of spatial patterns of gene expression during regeneration, and have identified key signaling molecules such as Wnt and Notch as playing a critical role in this process. However, these models have largely ignored the physical properties of the tissues in which regeneration occurs. In this thesis, we come back to the model presented in \cite{AnnaThesis} that integrates coupled reaction-diffusion to ODE models and see if we can reduce the amount of parameters, exhibit hysteresis and investigate the phenomenon of Turing Patterns / Far-From-Equilibrium patterns. Ultimately, this thesis aims to provide classical results on the topic and use these notions to further extend the analysis of the model.
