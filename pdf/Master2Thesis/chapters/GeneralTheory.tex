\section{General Theory}

In this thesis, we aim to investigate properties of a reaction-diffusion-ODE problem
 
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\del u}{\del t} = f(u, v, x)
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Spectral Bound
    \item Linear / NonLinear decomposition
    \item Bound on the Nonlinear part $\mathcal N$
    \item Spectral Mapping Theorem
    \item Why is the spectrum so important here
    \item Define DDI
    \item Maybe include Finn's result on the $d_1$ $d_2$ ? (and add full acknowledgement to his work)
    \item linearization of a PDE system
    \item Solving for the eigenvalue problem   
\end{itemize}
