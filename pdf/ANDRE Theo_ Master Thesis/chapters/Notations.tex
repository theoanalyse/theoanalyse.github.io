\section{Notations}

In the entirety of the thesis, we use the following naming conventions

\begin{itemize}
    \item $u$: the amount of free receptors
    \item $v$: the amount of ligands
    \item $w$: the amount of enzymes
    \item $X = (u, v, w) \in \R^3$: the information vector of each quantity in the system
    \item $\Delta$: The Neumann Laplace operator defined by $\Delta f = \sum_{j = 1}^n \frac{\del^2 f}{\del x_j^2}$ with domain $$\euD(\Delta) = \lc f \in \bigcap_{p\ge 1} W_{loc}^{2, p}(\Omega) : f, \Delta f \in \mathcal{C}(\Omega) \text{ and } \frac{\del f}{\del \nu} = 0 \text{ on } \del\Omega \rc$$
    \com{this notation is the one from \cite{Cygan2022}, maybe it is too sophisticaed for this thesis}
\end{itemize}
