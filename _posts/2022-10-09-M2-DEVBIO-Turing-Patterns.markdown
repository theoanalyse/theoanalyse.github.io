## Some biological context

Nature is known to present patterns, resulting from a perfect balance between regularity and chaos. Probably the most classical example one can give is the strangely regular distribution of petals and pistils in flowers. Based on this observations, mathematicians of the world started to try finding models that could describe best the emergence of these patterns. Some people see a close link with the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio $\phi \approx 1.618$, some see a connection to prime numbers' distribution but the existence or not of these links is beyond the scope of this report. We also observe the appearance of patterns in the animal. Whether it is the skin of the zebrafish, the stripes of the zebra, the spots of the giraffe, the back of the ladybug, or a mixture of spots and stripes in the leopard... It would seem that the model introduced in 1952 by Alan Turing, in his paper "The chemical basis of Morphogenesis", covers all these pigmentation processes involved in the generation of all this fauna of shapes.

The goal of this project is, thus, to present and study the 1-dimensional, 2-morphogens, reaction-diffusion equation across $p$-cells arranged on a torus of length $L$, as proposed in 1952.
